<h2>Rules API</h2>
<p>The following sample code snippets demonstrate one way of executing the 3 methods available in the Data Collector Rules API.</p>
<p>The snippets are available in the following programming languages:
	<ul>
		<li>
			C#</li>
		<li>
			Java</li>
		<li>
			PHP</li>
		<li>
			Python</li>
		<li>
