# Historical PowerTrack API Requests
## Python Examples

The following Python snippets demonstrate how to create and monitor jobs on the the Gnip Historical PowerTrack API.  HPT 2.0 has a separate file for creating a job, however the accept/reject and monitoring samples will work for both HPT 1.0 and HPT 2.0

CreateHistoricalJob: To run, replace credentials and replace {"value":"rule 1","tag":"ruleTag"},{"value":"rule 2","tag":"ruleTag"} with each rule and rule tag for testing.

    python CreateHistoricalJob.py
    python CreateHistoricalJob2.0.py
